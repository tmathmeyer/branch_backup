# Branch Backup

Do you have lots of branches and lots of unmerged commits in your project?
Is your repository stored on a failing hard drive while the replacement is
still in the mail? If this sounds like you, try this script! it will generate
patches in a nice folder structure so that you can re-create your branches
when that shiny new ssd comes in the mail five days behind schedule.

## Running:
```cd /path/to/risky/git/repo && python /path/to/branch_backup.py```

### Notes:
 - uses py3... psa for chrome devs who REFUSE to upgrade >:(
 - branches need to be rebased well - child branches can't be behind parents
 - branches with no upstream listed won't get archived. set your upstreams!
